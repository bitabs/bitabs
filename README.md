# Hya 👋 Nas here

👋 Full-stack engineer here, with a knack for flawlessly combining programming wizardry and stunning design. Let's keep it short and sweet:

- 🔭 Building my portfolio, crafting a killer Design System, and tackling tricky challenges.
- 🌱 Learning Rust, Go, and Bun—because who doesn't love adding new languages to their arsenal?
- 👯 Ready to collaborate on game-changing projects that leave a lasting impact on the dev community.
- 🤔 Seeking guidance from the Rust, Go, and Bun gurus out there. Help a developer out!
- 💬 Ask me anything about React, Js, or Design Systems—I've got you covered!
- 📫 Connect with me on LinkedIn, GitHub, or shoot me an email. Let's chat!
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding like a rockstar, you'll find me indulging in anime, hitting the gym, devouring blogs, and passionately despising UI inconsistencies.
